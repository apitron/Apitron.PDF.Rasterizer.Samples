1) Please make sure you have the Google Android Support Library installed: http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html
It can be installed using Android SDK Manager, run it and go to Extras\Android Support Library

2) If your Xamarin project doesn't have a reference to Android Support Library v4, add it as described below:
